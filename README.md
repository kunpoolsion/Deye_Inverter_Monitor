Simple solar system monitor.
Two versions:

Only web interface (esp8266/esp32)
LCD + Web interface (Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 Display board)

Independent and only wifi needed.

Tested on Deye Hybrid Inverters with Solarman wifi adapter (No triphasic systems tested)

Integrated Solarmanv5 protocol (ported from pysolarmanv5 and HomeAssistant descriptors)
WifiAP if no connection to change configuration (for lazy people that don´t wanna fight with compilation).

Some libraries were modded, use them to avoid compilation errors.
Flasheable BINs included.

ENJOY IT!
